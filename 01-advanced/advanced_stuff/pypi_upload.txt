sdist bdist explanation

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6292652/what-is-the-difference-between-an-sdist-tar-gz-distribution-and-an-python-egg#:~:text=sdist%20is%20a%20%22source%20distribution,sdist%20will%20require%20a%20compiler.
setup.py sdist creates a source distribution: it contains setup.py, the source files of your module/script 
(.py files or .c/.cpp for binary modules), your data files, etc. 
The result is an archive that can then be used to recompile everything on any platform.

setup.py bdist (and bdist_*) creates a built distribution: it includes .pyc files, .so/.dll/.dylib for binary modules, 
.exe if using py2exe on Windows, your data files... but no setup.py. The result is an archive that is specific to a platform 
(for example linux-x86_64) and to a version of Python, 
and that can be installed simply by extracting it into the root of your filesystem (executables are in /usr/bin (or equivalent), 
data files in /usr/share, modules in /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/...). 
You can even build rpm archives that can be directly installed using your package manager.
